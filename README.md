# iOS-9.x-JBME

Webkit exploit (for iOS 9.2 - 9.3.3 64 bit devices) written by qwertyoruiopz leveraging the Trident exploit chain to re-enable a jailbreak. Jailbreak by Pangu team. *I did not write most of this code* although I have started modifying it to learn more about how it works, primarily for my own use.
